# Conclusion

This project got very complex very fast and I learned some hard lessons about working with objects and how to organise code and work with both factory functions and classes. I am really happy I managed to get as many features working as I did and find it a really useful app in real life.

Features

- Add, remove or edit todos.
- Todos have due dates, priority and project indo.
- Filter through all todos using side bar.
- Clean and clear UI to display all information.
- Local storage to save your todos upon page reload.
